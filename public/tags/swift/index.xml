      <description>This post is not intended to be a tutorial on how to write your first app. It&#39;s merely my experience and maybe a general guideline on what to expect if you&#39;re trying to do this for the first time. If you already wrote an IOS app this post is probably not for you. I&#39;ve always considered that, in order to become better at something, you need to explore the surroundings. IT has a lot of sub-fields and, for a developer, the simplest way to explore is to play around with a new language.</description>
