      <description>This is the thing that has always stood in the way for me. I&#39;ve always looked at people I admired and questioned myself: why can&#39;t I do that? They seem so professional and confident. I would look like a fool compared to them. Then I started realising that, if I were to look back at that person (s)he was, at some point, a beginner. Any subject will eventually get complicated once you deep dive into it.</description>
