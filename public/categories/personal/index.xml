      <description>Alexandru Trandafir -- I&#39;m a software developer based in Bucharest, Romania.
I started this &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; with no exact plan on where to go with it. I plan writing not just about development, but about any subject that interests me.
You can find me via email or on linkedin
Opinions are my own.
Tools I use for this blog:  https://gohugo.io/ - this blog is powered by Hugo https://excalidraw.com/ - &amp;ldquo;hand&amp;rdquo; drawn diagrams http://wordpress.</description>

      <title>Make a fool out of yourself!</title>

      <description>This is the thing that has always stood in the way for me. I&#39;ve always looked at people I admired and questioned myself: why can&#39;t I do that? They seem so professional and confident. I would look like a fool compared to them. Then I started realising that, if I were to look back at that person (s)he was, at some point, a beginner. Any subject will eventually get complicated once you deep dive into it.</description>
