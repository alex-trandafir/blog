Every year I try to look back at the previous 12 months and see if I can gain insights into my behaviour. This is not necessary an easy task as I need to keep track of a lot of stuff during the year. Lucky for me I really enjoy doing it so it's not a dauting task. 

As a novelty this year I also tracked my expenses. The below graph is an iframe pointing towards <a href="/2021-review-data.html">a static html</a> I built with chart.js. 

{{< hp5 "/2021-review-data.html" >}}

#### Apps I use to track my data: 
* Fitbit for steps, sleep, weight & body fat (I own a Fitbit Aria scale)
* Whiteboard & <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/livebashco/image/upload/v1641933345/IMG_0531_Large_pkibnz.jpg">postits</a> for gym&sport occurences - for the past year I counted gym, tennis, hikes and surf towards this metric
* <a href="https://dollarbird.co/">Dollarbird app</a> for personal finance management. This is a totally manual process, I'm just disciplined enough to track all my expenses all the time

#### Insights
* This year is pretty weird, the data seems to be all over the place and there aren't many insights. I can make a lot of assumptions but as with all statistics it's a matter of correlation vs causation. 
* Higher weight & body fat -> higher resting BPM 
* The pandemic has dramatically hit my steps goal, but this isnt clear from the graphs above (I was averaging of 15-17k steps/day before covid/wfh)


#### Startup idea
* This is the second year I've posted this publicly on my social network(s). The interest is encouraging and I might explore this further as a maybe-startup idea.
