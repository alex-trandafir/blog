<p>This is the thing that has always stood in the way for me. I've always looked at people I admired and questioned myself: why can't I do that? They seem so professional and confident. I would look like a fool compared to them. Then I started realising that, if I were to look back at that person (s)he was, at some point, a beginner. </p>

<p>Any subject will eventually get complicated once you deep dive into it. The most recent subject I started exploring was coffee. Its pretty basic to make a cup of coffee. But if you go and explore the subject: the types of brewing, the variety of espresso machine models, grinders, recipes, bean origin, roasting, flavour, acidity, etc, you realise that even the most basic thing can become overwhelmingly complicated.</p>

<p>Somehow I ended up chickening out whenever I wanted to start something. I am well aware I'm going to look back at this someday and say "Man, I was so stupid" and that scares the shit out of me. The thing that scares me even more is if I won't do that. </p>

This subject has actually been researched and it's called the "Dunning-Kruger effect".
