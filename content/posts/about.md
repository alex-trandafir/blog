I'm a software developer based in Bucharest, Romania. 

I started this "blog" with no exact plan on where to go with it. I plan writing not just about development, but about any subject that interests me.

You can find me via <a href="mailto:hi@alextrandafir.com">email</a> or on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandru-trandafir-a3b9534b/">linkedin</a>

Opinions are my own.
