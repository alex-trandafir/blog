<p>I've stumbled upon this two times with personal projects and numerous times at work. It's a weird feeling that, even though you know you've done all the right things, keeps you from going into production. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I can't really talk much about work related stuff. However I can say that, even though we do all our testing within our teams, even though we have entire departments responsible with regression testing, even though we have very good incident management procedures, very good customer care services, very good infrastructure department, I still sometimes had a weird vibe regarding going into production. Luckily, I was always constrained by various deadlines to actually go live, and I never had any issues afterwards.</p>

<p>However, personal projects are different. You're never constrained and you always strive to do better. Obviously, I don't have the resources of an entire organization so testing, "regression", administration are all my responsability. I have projects that have been 99% done and never seen the light of day. Coming to think about it I think it's always been a fear of going live. </p>

# Application lifecycle 

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One thing most people overlook is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_lifecycle_management">application lifecycle</a>. You're not just pressing a "go live" button, but you also need to worry about traffic, memory management, metrics, bugs, failures, marketing, etc. You might actually end up doing a lot of things that you're not really into. I think fear of Production is a mix of all that. I tried to map all phases of a lifecycle to a feeling in the hopes it will help me:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

   Cycle | Feeling
--------|------
    Plan | :heart:
  Develop | :heart:
  Test | :unamused:
  Deploy | :heart_eyes: :cry:
  Maintain | :expressionless:


 However, I must admit that application lifecycle is not the only one that scares me. It's also the whole "is it good enough?" concept which I already know is bullshit, but it's a mental barrier I can't get past.

<p>One of the reasons I started writing is to try and hold myself accountable for.</p>
