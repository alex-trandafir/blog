<p>I've never realised it but getting into the field of IT, as someone with little to no background, can be extremely frustrating. Most articles out there are too technical and it can get scary really fast. What I'm hoping with this thread is to share some knowledge in <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=layman%27s%20terms">Layman's terms</a>. </p>

<p>This all started with my wife taking part in a software development bootcamp. I was expecting her to have knowledge about stuff that comes completely natural to me, but realised it's only so because I've been passionate (and in the field) for a long time. </p>

<p>If you're getting into IT the landscape has become so broad that even the best ones don't really have a grasp of it all. Just don't get scared and take it one step at a time. The information is presented in random order, it's not meant to be a course material or anything. It's also not meant to be 100% accurate.</p>

<p>There are a lot of topics in technology on which professionals don't necessarily agree upon, I'm not here to provide the "truth", but merely a perspective. I was mentioning earlier about my wife going through a software bootcamp: there have been plenty of times where I disagreed with the trainer. The thing is, we're only the sum of our experiences, so it's normal to feel different about the same subject. </p>

## What I'll cover

I don't have a definitive list at this point, but the topic will be oriented towards more basic concepts. I do plan to write stuff that's a bit more technical, I'll try to separate them in order to not mix things up. As a general rule I decied to include as much graphic content as possible (diagrams, mockups, etc).
